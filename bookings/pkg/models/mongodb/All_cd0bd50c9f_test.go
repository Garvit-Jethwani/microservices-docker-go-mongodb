/*
When creating test scenarios for the `All` function within the `BookingModel` struct, we must consider various conditions and edge cases that the function could encounter during execution. Below are potential test scenarios without writing the actual test code:

1. **Happy Path (Expected Behavior)**:
  - **Scenario**: The `All` function returns a slice of `Booking` objects without any error.
  - **Expected Result**: The function retrieves all booking records from the MongoDB collection successfully and returns them as a slice of `models.Booking`.

2. **Empty Collection**:
  - **Scenario**: The MongoDB collection is empty, and there are no booking records.
  - **Expected Result**: The function should return an empty slice of `models.Booking` and no error.

3. **Database Connection Error**:
  - **Scenario**: There is an issue with the database connection (e.g., the database is down).
  - **Expected Result**: The function should return an error that indicates the connection issue.

4. **Database Read Error**:
  - **Scenario**: There is an error when trying to read from the database.
  - **Expected Result**: The function should return an error that indicates the failure to read from the database.

5. **Invalid Data in Collection**:
  - **Scenario**: The bookings collection contains documents that do not match the `models.Booking` struct.
  - **Expected Result**: The function should return an error that indicates the data retrieved from the database can't be decoded into the `models.Booking` struct.

6. **Context Timing Out**:
  - **Scenario**: The context provided to the function times out before completing the database read operation.
  - **Expected Result**: The function should return a context deadline exceeded error.

7. **Nil Context**:
  - **Scenario**: The context passed to the function is `nil`.
  - **Expected Result**: The function may panic, or the MongoDB driver may handle the nil context in a specific way, such as creating a background context internally. The expected behavior will depend on the MongoDB driver's implementation.

8. **Iterating Over Large Collections**:
  - **Scenario**: The bookings collection is large, and retrieving all the documents might be resource-intensive.
  - **Expected Result**: The function should still return all the bookings, but performance metrics (like time taken and memory usage) should be monitored to assess efficiency.

9. **Cancellation of Context Mid-Execution**:
  - **Scenario**: The context is canceled while the function is in the process of fetching the bookings.
  - **Expected Result**: The function should return an error indicating that the operation was canceled.

10. **Database Cursor Error**:
  - **Scenario**: An error occurs while iterating over the cursor returned from the database.
  - **Expected Result**: The function should return the appropriate error that occurred while using the cursor.

11. **Connection Pool Exhausted**:
  - **Scenario**: All database connections are in use, and the function is unable to obtain one.
  - **Expected Result**: The function should return an error indicating that no database connections are available.

Note that these scenarios assume that the setup and tear down (such as initializing a MongoDB client, connecting to the database, and disconnecting) are managed outside the function. The scenarios also assume access to a MongoDB instance or a mock for testing purposes.
