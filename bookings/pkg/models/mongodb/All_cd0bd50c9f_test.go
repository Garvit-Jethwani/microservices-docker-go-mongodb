/*
To write test scenarios for the `All` function within the `BookingModel` that retrieves all bookings from a MongoDB collection, consider various aspects such as the state of the database, the data it contains, and potential edge cases. Below are some test scenarios:

1. **Happy Path Scenario**:
  - **Given** the database is available and contains a list of booking entries,
  - **When** the `All` method is called,
  - **Then** it should return a slice of all bookings without errors.

2. **Database Connection Issue**:
  - **Given** the database connection is not established or is having intermittent issues,
  - **When** the `All` method is called,
  - **Then** it should return an appropriate error indicating that the connection to the database failed.

3. **Empty Collection Scenario**:
  - **Given** the database is available but the bookings collection is empty,
  - **When** the `All` method is called,
  - **Then** it should return an empty slice of bookings with no errors.

4. **Invalid Data Scenario**:
  - **Given** the database contains data that does not match the `models.Booking` structure due to corrupt or incorrect entries,
  - **When** the `All` method is called,
  - **Then** it should return an error related to the inability to decode the data into the `models.Booking` structs.

5. **Timeout or Long Running Query Scenario**:
  - **Given** the database operation takes an unusually long time to execute or times out,
  - **When** the `All` method is called,
  - **Then** it should return a timeout error or an indication of the delayed execution.

6. **Large Volume of Data Scenario**:
  - **Given** the database contains a very large number of booking entries,
  - **When** the `All` method is called,
  - **Then** it should efficiently handle and return all entries, possibly testing for performance and memory usage.

7. **Cursor Error Scenario**:
  - **Given** there is an issue with obtaining or iterating over the cursor returned from the MongoDB query,
  - **When** the `All` method is called,
  - **Then** it should return an error indicating the issue with the cursor operations.

8. **Context Cancellation Scenario**:
  - **Given** the context passed to the database query is canceled before the operation completes,
  - **When** the `All` method is called with the canceled context,
  - **Then** it should return an error indicating the operation was canceled.

9. **Authorization or Permission Scenario**:
  - **Given** the credentials used for the database connection do not have permission to read from the bookings collection,
  - **When** the `All` method is called,
  - **Then** it should return an error related to insufficient permissions.

Each of these scenarios would be further defined with specific conditions and expected outcomes when implementing the actual test code. The scenarios provide a framework for ensuring that the `All` function behaves correctly under various circumstances and guards against potential issues that could arise during operation.
