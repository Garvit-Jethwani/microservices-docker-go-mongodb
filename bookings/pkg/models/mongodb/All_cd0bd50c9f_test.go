/*
   Here are several test scenarios to consider for the `All` function in the `BookingModel` which interacts with MongoDB to retrieve all booking records. These scenarios do not include actual test code but describe the conditions and expected outcomes for testing:

   1. **Empty Collection Test**: Verify that when the MongoDB collection is empty, the `All` function returns an empty slice of `models.Booking` and no error.

   2. **Single Document Test**: Test that when there is only one document in the MongoDB collection, the `All` function returns a slice containing a single `models.Booking` object corresponding to that document and no error.

   3. **Multiple Documents Test**: Ensure that when there are multiple documents in the MongoDB collection, the `All` function returns a slice of `models.Booking` objects with all the documents and no error.

   4. **Database Connection Error Test**: Simulate a scenario where the connection to the MongoDB database is not available or lost. The `All` function should return an error indicating that it cannot connect to the database.

   5. **Query Execution Error Test**: Mock a situation where the query to find documents (`m.C.Find`) fails due to an internal MongoDB error. The test should expect an error to be returned by the `All` function.

   6. **Cursor Retrieval Error Test**: Simulate an error during the retrieval of data from the cursor (`bookingCursor.All`). The test should verify that an error is returned if there is an issue while fetching the data from the cursor.

   7. **Context Timeout Test**: Check the behavior when the provided context (`ctx`) times out or is cancelled before the query completes. The `All` function should return a context-related error.

   8. **Data Decoding Error Test**: Mock a scenario where the data retrieved from the database cannot be decoded into the `[]models.Booking` slice due to a mismatch in the schema or data corruption. The test should expect an error related to data decoding.

   9. **Correct Data Test**: Verify that the data returned by the `All` function matches the actual documents in the MongoDB collection, ensuring that the function correctly decodes and returns the data.

   10. **Error Handling Consistency Test**: Confirm that all errors returned by the `All` function are consistent and informative, helping to diagnose the issue quickly without exposing sensitive information about the database or infrastructure.

   11. **Performance and Load Test**: Assess the performance of the `All` function under heavy load, ensuring that it can handle a large number of documents without significant performance degradation.

   12. **Security Test**: Ensure that the `All` function does not introduce any security vulnerabilities, such as exposure of sensitive data, injection attacks, or unauthorized access.

   Remember that these scenarios would need to be implemented using a testing framework appropriate for Go, such as the built-in `testing` package, and might require mocking the MongoDB interactions using a package like `gomock` or `mongo-go-driver/mongo/mongotest`.
