/*
1. Scenario: Delete a booking with a valid MongoDB ID
  - Given a MongoDB database with at least one booking
  - When the Delete function is called with a valid booking id
  - Then the booking should be removed from the MongoDB database
  - And the function should return a DeleteResult stating that one document was deleted

2. Scenario: Delete a booking with a non-existent MongoDB ID
  - Given a MongoDB database with at least one booking
  - When the Delete function is called with a non-existent booking id
  - Then the function should return a DeleteResult stating that no documents were deleted

3. Scenario: Delete a booking with an invalid MongoDB ID
  - Given a MongoDB database with at least one booking
  - When the Delete function is called with an invalid booking id that cannot be converted into an ObjectID
  - Then the function should return a conversion error

4. Scenario: Delete a booking on an empty database
  - Given an empty MongoDB database
  - When the Delete function is called with any booking id
  - Then the booking should not be removed from the MongoDB database because it's empty
  - And the function should return a DeleteResult stating that no documents were deleted

5. Scenario: Delete a booking with a valid ID in a disconnected state
  - Given a MongoDB server is down or unreachable
  - And an otherwise valid booking id
  - When the Delete function is called with the booking id
  - Then it should raise an error indicating that the database is unreachable

6. Scenario: Attempt to delete a booking without providing an ID
  - Given a MongoDB database with at least one booking
  - When the Delete function is called without providing an ID
  - Then the function should return an error indicating that the ID is invalid
