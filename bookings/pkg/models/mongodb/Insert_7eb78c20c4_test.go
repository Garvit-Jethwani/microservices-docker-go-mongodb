/*
1. Insert Valid booking: Test the scenario where the function should successfully insert a valid booking into the collection.

2. Insert Duplicate booking: This scenario should test the situation where the function attempts to insert a booking which already exists in collection.

3. Insert Nil booking: This scenario involves the test case for inserting a nil booking. There should be an error in this case since booking is empty.

4. Insert booking with Incomplete Fields: The test case for inserting a booking with incomplete fields. The function should return an error in this case.

5. Insert booking with invalid structure: Scenario in which the function tries to insert a booking object that does not align with the expected structure of a booking.

6. Insert booking with Missing Mandatory Fields: The function is given a booking object that lacks mandatory fields, and we expect an error as result.

7. Insert with Database Connection Problems: This scenario should test the error case in which the function attempts to insert a booking but is unable to because of issues with the connection to MongoDB.

8. Insert performance testing: It would be perfect to insert numerous bookings in a short timeframe to monitor its performance and to ensure the system can handle high traffic scenarios.

9. Insert with invalid context: Test case for inserting a booking with an invalid context as input. The function should return an error in this instance.

10. Insert with canceled context: Test the function when a context that has been canceled is used.
