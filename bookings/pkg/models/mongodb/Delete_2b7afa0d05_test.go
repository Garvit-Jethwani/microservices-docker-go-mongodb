/*
When testing the `Delete` function in a Go MongoDB scenario, you would want to cover various scenarios to ensure that it works as expected under different conditions. Here are some test scenarios that could be considered:

1. **Valid ID Test**: Pass a valid MongoDB object ID as a string and expect the function to successfully delete the document from the collection. Verify the return of a non-nil `*mongo.DeleteResult` and a `nil` error.

2. **Invalid ID Format Test**: Pass an invalid string (non hexadecimal or wrong length) that cannot be converted to a MongoDB object ID. Expect the function to return a `nil` `*mongo.DeleteResult` and a non-nil error (error related to ID parsing).

3. **Nonexistent ID Test**: Provide a validly formatted but nonexistent MongoDB object ID. Expect the function to return a `*mongo.DeleteResult` with a deleted count of 0 and a `nil` error.

4. **Empty ID Test**: Attempt to call the function with an empty string for the ID. Expect similar behavior as the invalid ID format test scenario.

5. **Database Connection Failure Test**: Simulate a scenario where there is a failure in the database connection (perhaps the MongoDB instance is down). Expect the function to return a `nil` `*mongo.DeleteResult` and a non-nil error indicating the connection issue.

6. **Collection Not Found Test**: Simulate a scenario where the specified collection isn't found in the database. Expect a `nil` `*mongo.DeleteResult` and a non-nil error that indicates the missing collection.

7. **Permission Denied Test**: Test with a user context that doesn't have permission to delete documents from the collection. Expect the function to return a `nil` `*mongo.DeleteResult` and a non-nil error regarding authorization or permissions.

8. **Handling of Write Concern Failures**: Configure the MongoDB client to use a write concern that can fail (e.g., it requires multiple acknowledgments in a single-node setup). Attempt a deletion and expect an error indicating the write concern wasn't met.

9. **Cancellation of Context**: Start a deletion with a cancellable context and cancel it before the operation is complete. Expect an error indicating the operation was canceled.

10. **Networking Issues Test**: Simulate networking issues between the service and the MongoDB instance, such as timeouts or disconnects. Expect an error indicating the operation could not be completed due to networking issues.

11. **Document With Relations**: If your database design includes relations and the deleted document is referenced elsewhere, test that the delete operation either cascades correctly or fails if it violates data integrity rules.

These scenarios cover a range of expected, boundary, and unexpected input cases, as well as different states of the system and database that may impact the `Delete` function's behavior.
