/*
Below are several test scenarios that can be considered for the `Delete` function in the provided code snippet:

1. Successful Deletion:
   - Scenario: The function is provided with a valid ID that exists in the database.
   - Expected Result: The function should return a successful `DeleteResult` (e.g., with a DeletedCount of 1) and no error.

2. Invalid ID Format:
   - Scenario: The function receives an ID that is not in the correct format (i.e., not a valid hex representation of an ObjectID).
   - Expected Result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error indicating the ID format is invalid.

3. Non-Existent ID:
   - Scenario: The function receives a validly formatted ID that does not correspond to any document in the database.
   - Expected Result: The function should return a `DeleteResult` with a DeletedCount of 0 and no error, as no document was found to delete.

4. Database Connection Error:
   - Scenario: There is an issue connecting to the MongoDB instance (e.g., network issues, authentication failure).
   - Expected Result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error indicating the connection issue.

5. Database Operation Error:
   - Scenario: There is an error during the execution of the delete operation (e.g., due to a misconfigured index or permission issues).
   - Expected Result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error indicating the operational issue.

6. Context Cancellation/Timing Out:
   - Scenario: The context provided to the function is cancelled or times out before the operation can complete.
   - Expected Result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error related to the context cancellation or timeout.

7. Write Concern Failure:
   - Scenario: The delete operation violates the database's write concern settings (e.g., cannot replicate to the required number of nodes before acknowledging the operation).
   - Expected Result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error indicating the write concern was not satisfied.

8. Incorrect Collection:
   - Scenario: The function attempts to perform the delete operation on a collection that does not exist or the `BookingModel` is misconfigured with the wrong collection.
   - Expected Result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error indicating the collection issue.

9. Edge Case with Empty ID:
   - Scenario: The function is called with an empty string for the ID.
   - Expected Result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error indicating the ID is not valid.

10. Multiple Concurrent Deletions:
    - Scenario: Multiple concurrent calls to the `Delete` function are made for the same ID.
    - Expected Result: The function should handle concurrent deletions gracefully, with the first call resulting in a successful deletion and subsequent calls either returning a DeletedCount of 0 with no error or handling the concurrent modification scenario appropriately.

By validating these scenarios, you would be able to ensure that the `Delete` function behaves correctly under various conditions and handles edge cases and errors as expected.
