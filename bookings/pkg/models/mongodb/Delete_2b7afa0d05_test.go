/*
1. Scenario: If a valid 'id' string is provided, the corresponding record from the MongoDB collection should be deleted. Keep track of the total count of collection's records before and after the delete operation to validate.

2. Scenario: When the 'id' string provided does not correspond to any existing record in the MongoDB collection. This should not cause an error, rather should return a DeleteResult object with 'DeletedCount' as zero.

3. Scenario: When a malformed 'id' string is provided, the method should return an error. Try with an 'id' that is not a valid hexadecimal representation.

4. Scenario: When an empty 'id' string is provided, the method should return an error since it cannot be parsed to ObjectID.

5. Scenario: If DeleteOne operation itself fails due to reasons unrelated to input (like database connection failure, etc.), it should throw an appropriate error.

6. Scenario: If the DeleteOne operation takes too long and exceeds the context deadline, an error should be thrown indicating that the operation has timed out.

7. Scenario: When the same 'id' is provided for deletion multiple times. The first time it should delete the record, subsequent deletion attempts should return 'DeletedCount' as zero.

8. Scenario: Attempt to delete a record while another deletion operation is in progress. It's possible that the second operation might not find the record (if the first operation has already deleted it) and should return 'DeletedCount' as zero.

9. Scenario: Test the deletion operation under a heavy load of concurrent deletion requests. This is to ensure that the method operates correctly under stress.

10. Scenario: When an 'id' of a recently deleted record is provided, it should return 'DeletedCount' as zero since the record would not exist in the database.
