/*
To validate the `Delete` function in the given Go code snippet that interacts with a MongoDB instance, you would want to consider the following test scenarios:

1. **Successful Deletion by Valid ID**
  - Scenario: Pass a string that can be successfully converted to a MongoDB `ObjectID` and corresponds to an existing document in the database.
  - Expected Result: The function should return a `mongo.DeleteResult` with a count greater than zero and a `nil` error.

2. **Deletion with Non-Existent ID**
  - Scenario: Pass a string that can be successfully converted to a MongoDB `ObjectID` but does not correspond to any document in the database.
  - Expected Result: The function should return a `mongo.DeleteResult` with a count of zero to indicate that no documents were deleted and a `nil` error.

3. **Invalid ObjectID Format**
  - Scenario: Pass a string that cannot be converted to a MongoDB `ObjectID` (e.g., a random string with an invalid format).
  - Expected Result: The function should return a `nil` `mongo.DeleteResult` and an error indicating that the conversion to `ObjectID` failed.

4. **Empty String as ID**
  - Scenario: Pass an empty string as the ID.
  - Expected Result: The function should return a `nil` `mongo.DeleteResult` and an error related to conversion to `ObjectID`.

5. **Nil or Closed MongoDB Connection**
  - Scenario: Invoke the `Delete` function when the `BookingModel` instance has a `nil` or closed MongoDB client connection.
  - Expected Result: The function should return a `nil` `mongo.DeleteResult` and an error indicating that the MongoDB client connection is not valid.

6. **Context Deadline Exceeded**
  - Scenario: Use a context with a very short deadline that expires before the delete operation can complete.
  - Expected Result: The function should return a `nil` `mongo.DeleteResult` and a context deadline exceeded error.

7. **Authorization or Permission Issues**
  - Scenario: The `BookingModel` instance's MongoDB client does not have proper permissions to delete a document from the collection.
  - Expected Result: The function should return a `nil` `mongo.DeleteResult` and an error indicating insufficient permissions.

8. **Network Issues**
  - Scenario: Simulate a network problem or disconnection between the application and MongoDB server during the delete operation.
  - Expected Result: The function should return a `nil` `mongo.DeleteResult`, and an error indicating that the delete operation could not be completed due to the network issue.

9. **Concurrent Deletion Conflict**
  - Scenario: Two or more concurrent delete operations try to delete a document with the same ID.
  - Expected Result: The function should handle the conflict gracefully, and at least one operation should return a deletion count of zero with a `nil` error if the document is already deleted.

10. **Database Server Down**
  - Scenario: Invoke the `Delete` function while the MongoDB server is down or unreachable.
  - Expected Result: The function should return a `nil` `mongo.DeleteResult` and an error indicating that the MongoDB server is unavailable.

11. **Collection Does Not Exist**
  - Scenario: Attempt to delete a document from a collection that does not exist.
  - Expected Result: Depending on the MongoDB configuration, the function should either create the collection and complete with a deletion count of zero or return an error.

Each of these scenarios would help to validate different aspects of the `Delete` function's behavior in response to various inputs and situations, ensuring robustness and proper error handling.
