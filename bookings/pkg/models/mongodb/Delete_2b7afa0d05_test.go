/*
To create test scenarios for the `Delete` function in a GoLang MongoDB service, consider the following:

1. **Successful Deletion Scenario:**
   - When the provided `id` is valid and corresponds to a document in the collection, ensure that the function deletes the record successfully.
   - Expected Outcome: The function returns a `mongo.DeleteResult` indicating one deletion and no error.

2. **Invalid ID Format:**
   - When the provided `id` has an improper format that cannot be converted into a valid `ObjectID`.
   - Expected Outcome: The function returns nil for the delete result and an error related to the invalid object ID format.

3. **Non-existent ID Scenario:**
   - When the provided `id` is a well-formed `ObjectID`, but there is no corresponding document in the collection.
   - Expected Outcome: The function returns a `mongo.DeleteResult` indicating zero deletions and no error.

4. **Database Connection Error:**
   - When there is an issue with the database connection or the collection (like the collection not being reachable or the database being down).
   - Expected Outcome: The function returns nil for the delete result and an error pertaining to the connection issue.

5. **Context Timeout / Cancellation:**
   - When the context provided to the MongoDB driver reaches a deadline or is cancelled before the operation completes.
   - Expected Outcome: The function returns nil for the delete result and an error related to the context being done.

6. **Authorization Failure:**
   - When the credentials in the context are not sufficient for deletion operation on the collection due to database permission restrictions.
   - Expected Outcome: The function returns nil for the delete result and an error relating to authorization.

7. **Invalid Collection Scenario:**
   - When the `BookingModel` struct has an invalid or misconfigured collection that does not exist or cannot be accessed for deletion.
   - Expected Outcome: The function returns nil for the delete result and an error that indicates the collection-related issue.

8. **Simulated Write Failure:**
   - When the write operation fails on the database side, which could be simulated in a test environment.
   - Expected Outcome: The function returns nil for the delete result and an error specifying the write failure.

9. **Simulated Partial Write Concern:**
   - When the delete operation returns with a partial write concern, meaning the delete may not be fully acknowledged by the database.
   - Expected Outcome: The function returns a `mongo.DeleteResult` potentially indicating a deletion, but an error might be thrown regarding the write concern.

10. **Test for Potential Data Races:**
    - When multiple delete operations are performed in rapid succession on the same `id`.
    - Expected Outcome: The function should consistently return a proper response indicating the document has been deleted, with subsequent calls indicating zero deletions and no error.

11. **Boundary Conditions:**
    - When the `id` is the edge value of being an empty string or contains only non-hexadecimal characters.
    - Expected Outcome: The function returns nil for the delete result and errors related to the invalid `ObjectID`.

Ensure that the database and context are appropriately mocked or controlled so that these scenarios target the behavior of the `Delete` function specifically, without external dependencies affecting the outcomes unpredictably.
