/*
 1. Test Scenario: Valid Object ID sent to the `Delete` function
    Description: Assert that when a valid Object ID is passed as parameter to the `Delete` function, one booking record corresponding to the passed ID is deleted from the MongoDB collection. Examine the `DeletedCount` field in the returned `DeleteResult` struct to ensure it equals 1, indicating one record was successfully deleted.

 2. Test Scenario: Invalid Object ID sent to the `Delete` function
    Description: Assert that when an invalid Object ID is passed to the `Delete` function, it must return an error. A properly formed Object ID is a 12-byte value consisting of a 4-byte timestamp, a 5-byte process unique, and a 3-byte incremented counter. Any parameter not adhering to this structure should trigger an error.

 3. Test Scenario: Non-existent Object ID sent to the `Delete` function
    Description: Assert that when an Object ID that does not exist in the collection is passed to the `Delete` function, the function executes without error but does not delete any records. The `DeletedCount` field of the returned `DeleteResult` struct should equal 0, indicating no records were deleted.

 4. Test Scenario: Context cancelled before operation is complete
    Description: Assert that when the context provided to the `Delete` function is cancelled before the deletion operation completes, the function should return an error.

 5. Test Scenario: Without any parameter sent to the `Delete` function.
    Description: Assert that when the `Delete` function is called without any parameter, it should return an error.

 6. Test Scenario: Object ID that belongs to a different collection is sent to the `Delete` function
    Description: Assert that when an Object ID that belongs to a different MongoDB collection is passed to the `Delete` function, the function must run without error but does not delete any records. The `DeletedCount` field of the returned `DeleteResult` must be 0 to indicate this.

 7. Test Scenario: Null or Empty String sent to `Delete` function
    Description: Assert that when null or an empty string is passed to `Delete` function, it should return an error as it does not match the length and structure of a valid Object ID.

 8. Test Scenario: Multiple calls to `Delete` function with the same valid Object ID
    Description: Assert that when the `Delete` function is called multiple times with the same Object ID, the first call should delete the record (if it exists) and successive calls should return `DeletedCount` as 0, as the record no longer exists.
