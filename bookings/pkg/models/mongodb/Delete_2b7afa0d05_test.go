/*
To develop test scenarios for the `Delete` function of a `BookingModel` that interacts with MongoDB, we should consider different cases and conditions that might affect the behavior of this function. Here are several scenarios to consider:

1. **Valid Deletion Scenario**
  - **Given** a valid `id` that corresponds to an existing booking document in the MongoDB collection.
  - **When** the `Delete` function is called.
  - **Then** the booking is successfully deleted from the collection, and a successful `DeleteResult` is returned.

2. **Non-existent Booking Scenario**
  - **Given** an `id` that does not correspond to any booking document in the MongoDB collection.
  - **When** the `Delete` function is called.
  - **Then** no document is deleted, and a `DeleteResult` indicating zero documents deleted is returned.

3. **Invalid ID Format Scenario**
  - **Given** an `id` that is not a valid `ObjectID` format.
  - **When** the `Delete` function is called.
  - **Then** an error is returned indicating that the `id` format is invalid.

4. **Database Connection Error Scenario**
  - **Given** a MongoDB connection issue or service downtime.
  - **When** the `Delete` function is called.
  - **Then** an error is returned indicating that the operation could not be completed due to a database connection error.

5. **Permission Error Scenario**
  - **Given** correct function usage, but the user does not have the necessary permissions to delete a booking.
  - **When** the `Delete` function is called.
  - **Then** an error is returned indicating that the user is unauthorized to perform the delete operation.

6. **Context Deadline Exceeded Scenario**
  - **Given** the operation takes longer than the provided context timeout.
  - **When** the `Delete` function is called.
  - **Then** an error is returned indicating that the context deadline has been exceeded before the operation could complete.

7. **Partial Delete Scenario (if possible)**
  - **Given** a transient error occurs during the delete operation, causing a partial delete (if the database supports it).
  - **When** the `Delete` function is called.
  - **Then** an error is returned indicating that a partial delete occurred.

8. **Cascading Delete Side Effects Scenario**
  - **Given** there are related documents that depend on the booking being deleted (e.g., appointments, payments).
  - **When** the `Delete` function is called.
  - **Then** ensure that there are no unintended side effects, like orphaned records.

These scenarios cover a range of possibilities, from the happy path to various error conditions that can arise due to input, external system state, or the operation of the `Delete` function itself. Keep in mind that actual test implementation might require mocking the database connection and operations to simulate different conditions.
