/*
1. Scenario: Test whether the Delete function deletes a record where the ID exists in the database.
Expectation: The function should successfully delete the record and return a DeleteResult showing that exactly one record was deleted, without raising any error.

2. Scenario: Test the Delete function with an ID that does not exist in the database.
Expectation: The function should return a DeleteResult showing that zero records were deleted, without raising any error.

3. Scenario: Test the Delete function with an empty string as ID.
Expectation: The function should raise an error because primitive.ObjectIDFromHex will fail to convert an empty string into a valid ObjectID.

4. Scenario: Test the Delete function with an invalid hex string (contains characters that are not hexadecimal) as ID.
Expectation: The function should return an error because primitive.ObjectIDFromHex will fail to convert the invalid hex string into a valid ObjectID.

5. Scenario: Test the Delete function when there's no connection to the MongoDB database.
Expectation: The function should raise an error because it cannot execute the deletion operation without a connection to the database.

6. Scenario: Test the Delete function with a valid hexadecimal string that is not 24 characters long.
Expectation: The function should return an error because primitive.ObjectIDFromHex needs a 24-character string to generate a valid ObjectID.

7. Scenario: Test the Delete function with a proper ID while the MongoDB server is down.
Expectation: The function should raise an error as it wouldn't be able to delete a record from a down server.

8. Scenario: Test the Delete function with a proper ID that was already deleted.
Expectation: The function should return a DeleteResult indicating that zero records were deleted, and should not raise an error.
