/*
Certainly! Below are test scenarios to validate the `Delete` function of the `BookingModel` that interacts with a MongoDB database. These scenarios don't require the actual test code but provide outlines regarding what should be tested:

1. **Valid ID Test**:
  - Test with a valid `ObjectID` string.
  - Expected result: The function returns a `DeleteResult` indicating the number of documents deleted and no error.

2. **Invalid ID Format Test**:
  - Test with an invalid `ObjectID` string (e.g., a string that is not a valid hexadecimal representation).
  - Expected result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error indicating that the ID is invalid.

3. **Empty ID Test**:
  - Test with an empty string for the `id` parameter.
  - Expected result: Similar to the invalid ID format test, an error should be returned due to failure in converting the ID.

4. **Non-Existent ID Test**:
  - Test with a valid `ObjectID` that does not exist in the database.
  - Expected result: The function should return a `DeleteResult` with a deleted count of `0` and no error.

5. **Database Connection Error Test**:
  - Simulate a scenario where the database connection is down or inaccessible.
  - Expected result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error indicating that the database is unreachable.

6. **Permission Denied Test**:
  - Simulate a scenario where the user does not have permission to delete documents from the collection.
  - Expected result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error indicating that the operation is not authorized.

7. **Timeout Test**:
  - Simulate a timeout scenario where the database operation takes too long and exceeds a pre-set threshold.
  - Expected result: The function should return `nil` for the `DeleteResult` and an error indicating that the operation timed out.

8. **Concurrent Deletion Test**:
  - Test a scenario where multiple concurrent requests are trying to delete the same document.
  - Expected result: Only one request should be able to delete the document, and subsequent requests should indicate that no documents were deleted.

9. **Correct Context Test**:
  - Verify that the function uses the correct context (`context.TODO()`) for the MongoDB operation.
  - Expected result: Function execution should proceed with the provided context without errors.

Ensure that each of these scenarios is properly represented in your test suite to validate the behavior of the `Delete` function comprehensively. Keep in mind that for some of these tests, you would need to set up mocks or stubs for the database operations to simulate different conditions without interacting with an actual database.
