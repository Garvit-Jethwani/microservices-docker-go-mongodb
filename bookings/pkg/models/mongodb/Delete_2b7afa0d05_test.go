/*
Below are several test scenarios for the `Delete` function in the provided Go code snippet. These scenarios do not contain test code but describe the purpose and expected outcome of each test:

1. **Valid ID Deletion**
  - _Scenario_: Pass a valid `ObjectID` as a string to the `Delete` function.
  - _Expected Outcome_: The function should successfully convert the string to a `primitive.ObjectID` and delete the corresponding booking document from the collection. The function should return a `mongo.DeleteResult` indicating that one document was deleted and no error.

2. **Invalid ID Format**
  - _Scenario_: Attempt to delete a booking with an invalidly formatted `ObjectID` string (e.g., not a hexadecimal string or incorrect length).
  - _Expected Outcome_: The function should return `nil` and the error indicating that the string could not be converted to `primitive.ObjectID`.

3. **Non-existent Booking Deletion**
  - _Scenario_: Pass a valid but non-existent `ObjectID` to the `Delete` function (i.e., an `ObjectID` that does not correspond to any document in the collection).
  - _Expected Outcome_: The function should perform the operation and return a `mongo.DeleteResult` indicating that zero documents were deleted, along with no error since a non-existent id is not an error scenario for deletion.

4. **MongoDB Connection Issue**
  - _Scenario_: Trigger a connection issue with MongoDB when attempting to call the `Delete` function.
  - _Expected Outcome_: The function should attempt to execute the deletion but fail to connect to the database and hence return `nil` and an error indicating the connection issue.

5. **Database Write Lock**
  - _Scenario_: The MongoDB instance has a write lock and does not allow deletions when the `Delete` function is called.
  - _Expected Outcome_: The function should return `nil` and an error that indicates the database operation could not be performed due to the write lock.

6. **Context Cancellation**
  - _Scenario_: Pass a context that gets canceled before the delete operation can finish.
  - _Expected Outcome_: The function should return `nil` and the error should indicate that the operation was canceled due to the context being done.

7. **Timeout Exceeded**
  - _Scenario_: Set a very short timeout in the context, causing it to exceed the timeout before the delete operation can complete.
  - _Expected Outcome_: The `Delete` function should return `nil` and an error signaling that the timeout was exceeded before the deletion could occur.

Remember that these scenarios are only for the purpose of outlining what should be tested; the actual results could vary depending on the state of the MongoDB server and database, as well as the implementation details of the `BookingModel` and its `Delete` method. Additionally, precise behavior may also depend on how errors and results are handled by `mongo.DeleteOne` method from the MongoDB Go Driver.
