/*
   Given the function `FindByID` which retrieves a booking by its ID from a MongoDB collection, here are some potential test scenarios to validate its behavior without writing the actual test code:

   1. **Valid ID Test**: Test that when a valid ObjectID string is provided, the function returns the correct `models.Booking` object without errors.

   2. **Invalid ID Format Test**: Test that when an invalid ObjectID string is provided (e.g., not a 24-character hex string), the function returns an error (specifically, an error related to invalid ObjectID format).

   3. **Non-Existent ID Test**: Test that when an ObjectID string that does not correspond to any document in the database is provided, the function returns a "ErrNoDocuments" error.

   4. **Database Connection Error Test**: Simulate a scenario where the database connection is not available or the query cannot be executed due to a connection issue, and ensure that the function returns an appropriate error.

   5. **Decode Error Test**: Simulate a scenario where the `Decode` function fails (e.g., due to a mismatch between the retrieved document and the `models.Booking` struct), and ensure that the function returns an error.

   6. **Context Cancellation Test**: Test that the function correctly handles a canceled context (e.g., using `context.WithCancel`) and returns an appropriate error if the context is canceled before the database operation completes.

   7. **Timeout Test**: Simulate a scenario where the database operation exceeds a certain time limit set by a context with timeout, and ensure that the function returns a context deadline exceeded error.

   8. **Correct Context Test**: Verify that the function uses the provided context (`context.TODO()` in this case) correctly in its database operation.

   9. **Empty ID Test**: Test that when an empty string is provided as the ID, the function returns an error related to invalid ObjectID format.

   10. **Struct Field Mapping Test**: Ensure that the fields from the MongoDB document are correctly mapped to the `models.Booking` struct fields, and that all necessary fields are present and properly formatted.

   11. **Partial Document Test**: If the MongoDB document contains only a subset of the fields required by the `models.Booking` struct, test that the function either returns an error or correctly handles partial documents.

   12. **Case Sensitivity Test**: If the MongoDB collection uses case-sensitive field names, test that the function correctly retrieves documents regardless of the case used in the query.

   Keep in mind that to perform these tests, you would typically use a mocking framework to simulate the MongoDB collection behavior, or you would perform integration tests against an actual MongoDB instance with controlled data for consistent test results.
