Scenario 1: Successful Retrieval of All Bookings

Details:
    Description: This test aims to check if the function can successfully retrieve all bookings from the database without any errors.
Execution:
    Arrange: 
      - Mock the collection using a well-behaved mongo.Collection mock.
      - Implement a mock cursor with matching behavior.
      - Have this mock return a list of predefined bookings upon calling Find().
    Act: 
      - Call the All() function.
    Assert: 
      - Check that the function returns the predefined list of bookings and no error.
Validation: 
    Verification of the correct returned list and error ensures that the database reading functionality works as expected. The test assures that the function can correctly read data from the database without any errors.

Scenario 2: Failed Retrieval due to Erroneous Find()

Details:
    Description: This scenario checks if the function handles errors that occur during the Find() operation.
Execution:
    Arrange: 
      - Using the same mock arrangement as before but return a predefined error upon calling Find().
    Act: 
      - Call the All() function.
    Assert: 
      - Check that the function returns nil and the predefined error.
Validation:
    This test ensures that the function correctly handles and returns errors that occur during the Find() operation. It's crucial in maintaining the robustness of the program, particularly when dealing with unreliable environments such as databases.

Scenario 3: Failed Retrieval due to Erroneous Cursor All()

Details:
     Description: This scenario checks if the function handles an error that occur during the Cursor.All() operation.
Execution:
    Arrange: 
      - Have the mock cursor return a predefined error when calling All().
    Act: 
      - Call the All() function.
    Assert: 
      - Check that the function returns nil and the predefined error.
Validation:
    This test ensures that the function correctly handles and returns errors that occur during the All() operation. This is crucial for managing potential cursor errors which are returned from the database. 

Scenario 4: Retrieval of Empty List

Details:
    Description: This test scenario checks if the function correctly handles a scenario where there are no bookings in the database.
Execution:
    Arrange: 
      - Have mock cursor return an empty list when calling Find().
    Act: 
      - Call the All() function.
    Assert: 
      - Check that the function returns an empty list and no error.
Validation:
     This test helps validate the function can correctly handle and return an empty list when there are no bookings. Manipulating empty or nil slices is common in Go and checking if the code handles them correctly is necessary for avoiding runtime errors.
